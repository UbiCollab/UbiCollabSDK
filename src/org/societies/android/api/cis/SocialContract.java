	 * <li>Which members a community has.</li>
	 * <li>Which types of membership a user has in a community.</li>

	 * 
	 * You might have different levels of information for the different

	 * 
	 * <h1>Insert</h1> 
	 * Applications can insert memberships. Applications will have to provide the following
	 * parameters in when inserting memberships:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>{@link GLOBAL_ID_MEMBER}
	 * <li>{@link GLOBAL_ID_COMMUNITY}
	 * <li>{@link TYPE}

	 * When an application inserts a membership, SYNC_STATUS will be
	 * set to "pending" by {@link SocialProvider}. This has to be changed
	 * by a SyncAdapter upon next successful synchronization.
	 * 
	 * SyncAdapters can also insert services. SyncAdapters have to
	 * set the following parameters in the query in order to insert successfully:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>{@link GLOBAL_ID}
	 * <li>{@link GLOBAL_ID_MEMBER}
	 * <li>{@link GLOBAL_ID_COMMUNITY}
	 * <li>{@link TYPE}

	 * Applications can update:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>{@link TYPE}

	 * SYNC_STATUS has to be set to "updated" by the SyncAdapter.

	 * Applications can delete memberships. A user (and his/her logged in

	 * <li>Memberships that involve communities where the user is owner.</li> 
	 * </ul>
	 * 
	 * <br />
	 * SyncAdapters can delete any membership.
	 *

	 * Applications and SyncAdapters can query for memberships using standard
	 * query URI or using _ID as the last part of the URI.
